# 🎨 Doraemon Character in Pure HTML & CSS

A creative front-end project to design the iconic cartoon character **Doraemon** using only **HTML** and **CSS**.  
No images, SVGs, or background-image URLs — purely hand-crafted with div, span elements, and clever CSS styling.

---

## 📌 Description

This project visually recreates Doraemon's face and collar in pure HTML and CSS.  
The design includes:
- Doraemon's big round face
- Eyes with pupils
- Red nose and vertical facial line
- Smile/mouth curve
- Characteristic whiskers on both sides
- Red collar and yellow bell with detailing

The character is built using nested `div` and `span` elements for each feature, styled via CSS with properties like `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, `transform`, and absolute positioning.

---

## 📌 Approach

- The **HTML structure** divides Doraemon’s face, eyes, nose, mouth, whiskers, collar, and bell into separate container elements.
- **CSS styling** uses absolute positioning for precise alignment, `border-radius` for circular shapes, and `transform` for whisker angles.
- Decorative details like bell shine and nose highlights are created using pseudo-elements and inner spans.

## 📌 Character Used  
**Doraemon** — the famous blue robotic cat from Japanese manga and anime, known for his round face, red nose, and magic pocket (face-only version here).

---

## 📌 CSS Properties and Techniques Used

- `border-radius` for circles and curves
- `box-shadow` for highlights and depth
- `position: absolute` for element alignment
- `transform: rotate()` for angled whiskers
- `float` for eye positioning
- Pseudo-classes like `nth-child()` for targeting multiple elements
- Flexibility with `div` and `span` nesting for modular structure

---

## 📌 Challenges Faced

- Achieving symmetrical placement of eyes and whiskers without flexbox or grid
- Crafting curved smile and vertical face line using borders and positioning
- Designing bell details (shine, stripes, button) purely with spans and borders
- Managing overlap and layering of multiple elements with z-index and stacking context
