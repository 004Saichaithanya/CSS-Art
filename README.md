# ðŸŽ¨ Doraemon in Pure HTML & CSS

A fun, creative project recreating the famous cartoon character **Doraemon** using only **HTML and CSS**. No images, SVGs, or external assets â€” built entirely from basic elements like `div` and CSS properties like `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, `position`, and `transform`.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This project represents a pixel-style Doraemon face and upper body using pure frontend code. It includes all of Doraemon's iconic features:
- Big round blue face
- White face patch
- Eyes with black pupils
- Red nose
- Smile with tongue
- Whiskers
- Gold bell on his collar
- His famous rounded magic pocket

---

## ðŸ“Œ Approach

- **HTML Structure:** Built using multiple nested `div` elements for each facial and body feature.
- **CSS Styling:** Applied absolute positioning, border-radius for circular shapes, background colors for fills, box-shadow for depth, and pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) for extra detailing like the bell's clapper and pocket line.
- **No images or SVG graphics were used.**
